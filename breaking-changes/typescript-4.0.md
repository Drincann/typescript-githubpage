## Breaking Changes

### `lib.d.ts` Changes

Our `lib.d.ts` declarations have changed - most specifically, types for the DOM have changed.
The most notable change may be the removal of [`document.origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/origin) which only worked in old versions of IE and Safari
MDN recommends moving to [`self.origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/origin).

### Properties Overriding Accessors (and vice versa) is an Error

Previously, it was only an error for properties to override accessors, or accessors to override properties, when using `useDefineForClassFields`; however, TypeScript now always issues an error when declaring a property in a derived class that would override a getter or setter in the base class.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 1049 2610
class Base {
  get foo() {
    return 100;
  }
  set foo(value) {
    // ...
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  foo = 10;
}
```

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2611
class Base {
  prop = 10;
}

class Derived extends Base {
  get prop() {
    return 100;
  }
}
```

### Operands for `delete` must be optional.

When using the `delete` operator in `strictNullChecks`, the operand must now be `any`, `unknown`, `never`, or be optional (in that it contains `undefined` in the type).
Otherwise, use of the `delete` operator is an error.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2790
interface Thing {
  prop: string;
}

function f(x: Thing) {
  delete x.prop;
}
```

### Usage of TypeScript's Node Factory is Deprecated

Today TypeScript provides a set of "factory" functions for producing AST Nodes; however, TypeScript 4.0 provides a new node factory API.
As a result, for TypeScript 4.0 we've made the decision to deprecate these older functions in favor of the new ones.
